# Blackpool

Blackpool is a seaside resort in Lancashire, England. It is served predominantly by two stations - Blackpool North and Blackpool South, each at the end of a branch line. Blackpool forms a popular tourist destination throughout the year, with the Blackpool Tower, Pleasure Beach, and Blackpool Zoo all within walking distance of the stations. The Blackpool Illuminations in winter are also very popular. Blackpool Tramway is the UK's only surviving first generation tramway, and still runs some original stock. As such, passengers numbers in and out of the town are very high year round, and the simple two track railway to Preston can struggle to cope.

Most services operate to Blackpool North from various locations across the north of England. These are operated by Northern Trains. Additionally, Avanti West Coast run several services a day to and from London Euston, via Birmingham. Blackpool South is served by a shuttle service to Preston roughly hourly, constrained by being on a single track branch from the Blackpool North line.

## Simulation

The timetable includes the following standard off peak services:

- 2tp3h Liverpool Lime Street to Blackpool North (NT)
- 1tph Manchester Airport to Blackpool North (NT)
- 1tph Hazel Grove to Blackpool North (NT)
- 1tph Preston to Blackpool South (NT)
- 1tp2h London Euston to Blackpool North (VT)

Some additional services operate during peak hours, and there are a few ECS moves to and from Blackpool North Carriage Sidings throughout the day.

## Operational Tips

- Be careful with the level crossing - try not to set routes across it too early, but also avoid forcing trains to slow down when approaching it.
- Keep an eye on the times trains are due to arrive at Kirkham & Wesham - be careful not to block the line waiting for a train from Blackpool South.
- Watch out for the joining service in the morning. One train arriving at Blackpool North joins with another out of the depot - make sure to send them into the same platform!
